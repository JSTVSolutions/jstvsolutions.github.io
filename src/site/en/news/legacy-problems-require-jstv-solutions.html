<p>
  Our client is a family-run retail business and auction house that specializes
  in one-of-a-kind artwork and unique memorabilia. As they have grown over the
  years, they have accumulated disparate software and business processes that
  needlessly wastes time and is error prone. Performing essential business tasks
  such as inventory management, order tracking, and client relationship
  management, became a huge burden for their small team.
</p>
<p class="mt-8">
  JSTV Solutions built a new, modern e-commerce website that runs directly off
  of their legacy FileMaker database, with the flexibility to further expand
  into customer relationship management and eventually into auction
  functionality. In addition to a reduced workload, the solution provides our
  client with real time inventory management, and access to metrics that will
  give them the insight they need to grow their business without overworking
  their team.
