  JSTV Solutions is pleased to announce that Sumario, the best way to handle
  forms on any website, is now freely available under the GNU Affero General
  Public License. Its source code, and everything needed to deploy Sumario on
  Fly.io is available on GitLab.

  Tom and Jeff met while in the MBA program at Loyola Marymount University where
  their ambitions to help businesses streamline their operations with simple and
  secure software services collided. First Tom and Jeff developed Ledgery, a
  payroll and tax preparation service for new, small businesses. They
  followed-up with Sumario shortly afterwards. We believe Sumario was the first
  of its kind, and we were pleased to see our idea validated by other, similar
  solutions that came later. However, we never did see the adoption we had hoped
  for and felt Sumario deserved. Sadly, we eventually shelved Sumario in 2017.
</p>
<p class="mt-8">
  While Tom and Jeff were recently reflecting on the success JSTV Solutions has
  had and discussing our next steps, the idea of reviving Sumario came up. We
  think we've learned a lot since we first launched Sumario and have a much
  better chance at making Sumario a commercial success, but at the same time we
  have other responsibilities now that won't allow us to spend the time on
  Sumario we think that requires. With this in mind we decided to open source
  Sumario.
</p>
<p class="mt-8">
  Like our passion for remote work, our passion for open source software
  predates its popularity. Tom had already made contributions to Linux, Perl,
  and the Apache web server before the term open source had been invented. We
  knew that Sumario wouldn't help anyone in its current, archived state. This
  release of Sumario as open source is its most natural evolution to us.
</p>
<p class="mt-8">
  The only updates we've made have been to update Sumario's dependencies, and
  run it on Fly.io instead of AWS. We believe this really lowers the barrier to
  others to deploy Sumario on their own, but still provides a simple and
  performant service. We've created a handful of tickets with some changes we
  think need to be made in the short-term, but we've held off on making
  long-term plans. We're excited to see a community grow around Sumario, and
  look forward to see the direction it wants Sumario to take. We hope you'll
  join us on this adventure on GitLab. For those who prefer to let someone else
  deploy Sumario for them, we are happy to once again offer Sumario as an
  affordable, paid service at
