<p>
  Our client makes advanced digital beamforming telemetry systems for the
  aerospace industry. They were working on numerous projects in parallel, each
  with an aggressive deadline. They needed someone who could come up to speed
  quickly, be responsible for some key components, and deliver on time and on
  budget with minimal supervision.

<p class="mt-8">
  They tapped JSTV Solutions because of the work that one of our co-founders had
  already done in this area. We designed and implemented a client/server
  protocol, and built a sophisticated, native desktop app in Qt which our client
  used to test and control their telemetry systems. It was a challenge, but we
  met every milestone much to the delight of their customers.
