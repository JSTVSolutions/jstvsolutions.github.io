<p>
  Our client uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), including OpenSearch, to provide
  their end users with insights into their IT infrastructure, such as known
  security vulnerabilities and detection of active attacks. As usage of their
  SaaS product increased, our client's AWS bill grew and their end users
  suffered extreme latencies.

<p class="mt-8">
  JSTV Solutions reviewed their architecture and provided them with a summary of
  improvements to make, which included how they ingested and indexed their data,
  as well as the queries they used to search across their large data sets. As a
  result, end user latency averages decreased from 27 seconds to 0.5 seconds,
  and search queries were 94% faster.
