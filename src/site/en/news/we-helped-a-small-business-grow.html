  Everyone has their favorite coffee shop, taco stand, or burger joint, and
  those of us at JSTV Solutions are no exception. One of our co-founders has
  been going to the same coffee shop for over a decade, and has gotten to know
  the staff and owners well.

  One day, one of the coffee shop owners was lamenting how slow and difficult it
  was for his customers to use their website. The website had not been updated
  in a while, and he was receiving notifications about security vulnerabilities
  that he didn't understand. He had reached out to some website builders who
  were offering really expensive rewrites that involved a bunch of techno mumble
  jumble he also didn't understand.
</p>
<p class="mt-8">
  This problem was taking up too much of his time and took him away from running
  his business. We offered to take a look, and came up with a plan to move their
  website over to Squarespace. It was quick and cheap, and now they have a
  website that they can update and easily maintain on their own. While we
  normally work on hard, complex problems, we also really love simple solutions.
